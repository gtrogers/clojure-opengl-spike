#Loading and using openGL shaders in clojure

##Getting set up
In addition to running `lein deps` you'll also need to grab the native 
Lightweight Java Game Library jars for your system from 
http://www.lwjgl.org/download.php and put them in `clojure-opengl-spike/native`. 
Once that's done a `lein trampoline run` should get things underway.
